# WSU-Social
Social media website that enables WSU students to connect with and interact with other WSU students.
# Functionality
The functionality behind WSU Social is to have students create their personalized profile, with their interests and hobbies. The student can join and post in other organizations that were created by students at Wayne State, as well as post under their own profile.
# Purpose
The purpose of WSU Social is to create a solution to students feeling isolated during the pandemic. The solution for this is to create a separate web page, similar to academica, but with the sole purpose of it being for Wayne State students that are looking for other students to talk to (virtually, of course). The students should be able to post their interests, hobbies, and contact information, if the student wanted to put themselves out there for others to interact with.
